This C# program demonstrates the implementation of recursive methods to calculate Fibonacci and factorial values. It includes two functions: fibonacci, which calculates the Fibonacci value for a given number, and factorial, which computes the factorial of a number. The program outputs the Fibonacci value of 10 and the factorial of numbers from 1 to 4.
